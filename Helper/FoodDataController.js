            The input is extracted text from a hotel menu card. Your task is to:
            1. Identify and group all food items under their relevant categories (e.g., 'Biryani', 'Drinks', 'Desserts').
            2. Ensure all food names, categories, and prices are spelled correctly and formatted consistently.
            3. Detect and include the correct price for each item. Retain the original currency format for prices (e.g., '$', 'â‚¹', 'rupees').
            4. Assign missing categories based on the context of the input text intelligently.
            5. Ignore irrelevant or non-food-related text.
            6. Include a 'Type' field for each food item as 'veg' or 'Non-veg' based on the dish's type.
            7. Provide a brief 3-5 line description in the 'Info' field to attract customers.
            8. Provide a 'Rating' field with values between 1 to 5 based on the food item's appeal.
            9. Ensure the JSON structure is consistent.

            Structure the output strictly as:
            [
              {
                "category": "category_name",
                "items": [
                  {
                    "food": "food_name",
                    "price": 200,
                    "Type": "veg/Non-veg",
                    "Rating": 1-5,
                    "Info": "Brief description"
                  }
                ]
              }
            ]

            Input text:
            [${extractedText}]

            Important Notes:
            - Return only the JSON response in the specified structure, with no additional text, commentary, or formatting.
            - Ensure that all text adheres to proper grammatical and capitalization rules.
            - Do not include any formatting annotations such as \`\`\`.
